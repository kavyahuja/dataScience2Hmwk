Homework 17 : Question 3
Use the ScalaTion class AR to develop Auto-Regressive Models for p = 1,2,3, for the Lake Level Time-series Dataset. Plot yˆt and yt versus t for each model. 
 
 
 p is equal to hyper parameter 
equation for 0 centered AR model included past p values 
 zt = φ0zt−1 + φ1zt−2 + ... + φp−1zt−p + εt

the forcasted value for one step ahead(h=1) is calculated by 
 zˆ=φz +φz +...+φp−1 t−p
